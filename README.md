# competitive-coding

A collection of my solutions to competitive programming problems.

The "online judge" folder contains solutions to problems in http://onlinejudge.org, the files are named after the problem id.

The "code jam" folder contains solutions and attempts to past google code jam competitions, the files are named after the year and round of the problem.

The "kattis" folder contains solutions to problems in https://open.kattis.com, the files are named after the problem id.

All code is written in competitive programming style, i.e. no comments and simple variable names. This is not my coding style when writing code without time constraints.
